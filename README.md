# Hand-FaceRefiner
ComfyUI Hand Face Refiner

Download .json and add to ComfyUI/web folder. Use "Load" button on Menu.


FOR HANDS TO COME OUT PROPERLY:

The hands from the original image must be in good shape. The refiner improves hands, it DOES NOT remake bad hands. It detects hands and improves what is already there. It will only make bad hands worse. It MAY occasionally fix alignment errors (rare).

FACE REFINER:

Works great. I wouldn't mess with it much.
